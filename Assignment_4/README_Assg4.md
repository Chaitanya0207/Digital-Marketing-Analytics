•	Case: 	Working at Snackfair, a custom snack shipping company that only has an online presence and the company competed against many online subscription services
( https://www.mysubscriptionaddiction.com/best-snack-subscription-boxes ) and wants to differentiate themselves with their superior recommendation system. The team is
interested in upgrading their recommendation system and have asked the team to put together a prototype of a recommendation system for Light GBM Gradient Boosting Tree algorithm for
fast training and low memory usage. Also, to build a prototype using Streamlit to illustrate how to use.
	
## Assignment 4

•	Claat Link for Assignment: https://codelabs-preview.appspot.com/?file_id=1BP0cB5Ua-D5JAieAhJbcPthKsJMHACmT8hJ6W1GJc8Y#2
•	Google doc Link : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BP0cB5Ua-D5JAieAhJbcPthKsJMHACmT8hJ6W1GJc8Y/edit#heading=h.nj23sjpj5u97

## Objective

•	The goal of this assignment is to prototype, build, evaluate and deploy a recommendation system by implementing LightGBM.

## Tools

 1) Python 3.6
 2)	Streamlit

## Future Enhancements
 
 1)We can focus on optimizing the model performance by hyperparameter tuning and cross validation.
 2) Developing a more dynamic user friendly dashboards
 


#### Steps to be followed to code using Jupyter notebook and Python 3.6.8

To setup on your local machine:

1) Install Anaconda with Python >= 3.6. Miniconda is a quick way to get started.
2) Generate a conda-environment yaml file(generate_conda_file.py) which you can use to create the target environment using the Python version 3.6 with all the correct dependencies.
3) Assuming the repo is cloned as Recommenders from (https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders), create a conda environment (conda env create -f reco_base.yaml) running the python script mentioned in 2.
2) Start the Jupyter notebook server
		jupyter notebook
3) Download the data from the attached datasheet (Data_Input.csv)
 
### Step to be followed to visualise using Streamlit
 
 1) Installing the streamlit using the following command (pip install streamlit)
 2) Import Streamli, run the app using the command Streamlit run <filename.py>
 3) Derive insights from the above tabs/dashboards.
