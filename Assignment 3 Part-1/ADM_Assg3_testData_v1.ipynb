        "->  TV spending is definitely benefitting our sales. From our analysis, we confirm that spending on TV ads, we observe there is both an increase and decrease in sales since it is nonlinearly related, but overall there is an increase because of the awareness and publicity created by the ads resulting in a positive impact. Yes we can quantify the sales by taking the difference between tv_Sales_1 and base_line, tv_Sales_2 and base_line.\n",
