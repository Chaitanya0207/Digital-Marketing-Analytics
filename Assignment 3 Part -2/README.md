•	Case: 

	Marketa Analytics came across this blog and is intrigued on using the LTA and Logistic regression approach to determine the weights that can be attributed to campaigns. They are also interested in how LTA, Logistic regression models compare with time-decay, U-shaped, Linear and FTA.
	
## Assignment 3 - Part 2

•	Claat Link for Assignment: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A_5VDgKlg3dfQ3WEnj7auvrGuP6XQsiTHwVoWnCV3iY/edit?ts=5e646516#

## Objective

•	To analyze the models after implementing them and simulate ROI for each of the 4 models showing which model is preferred. 

## Tools

 1) Bokeh Server
 2)	Google Colaboratory
 3) Pandas for Data Analysis

## Future Enhancements
 
 1) Developing a more dynamic user friendly dashboards
 2) Manipulating the models to optimize their efficiency 
 
 
## How to work with bokeh server
 
#### Steps to be followed to visualize data using bokeh server
 
 1) Installing the necessary libraries to install bokeh server. (pip3 install bokeh)

 2) Importing the libraries required to plot the graphs in bokeh server (eg. Hover, VBar, ColumnDataSource etc.)

 3) Be sure to call the defined functions inside the main class for each of those models 
   
 4) Develop the type of graph you would like to visualise your ROI in.
    
 5) Create the Panels, Tabs and Dashboard with associated logic as:

	 •	LTA
	 •	FTA
	 •	Linear
	 •	Logistic
	 •	U-shaped
	 •	Time Decay
	 •	Simulation
 
    
 4) Derive insights from the above tabs/dashboards.
